# Close DropBox on Metered Connection 

A utility closes dropbox when running on a metered connection. 
This was a annoyingly using all my data when moving house when I forgot to turn dropbox off when hot-spotting myself. 
Unlike OneDrive, dropbox does not handle metered connections... 

To Do: 
- Add a UI popup asking user if they wish to kill dropbox
